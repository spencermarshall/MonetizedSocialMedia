I created an auto-Twitter posting bot that posts hourly Star Wars Quotes. Each episode of THE CLONE WARS begins with a little inspirational quote. So I pulled every quote from the Internet and wrote this script to post a random one to Twitter(X). 
It runs hourly on my home computer so if my computer isn't running it won't post the quote. But that's alright.
